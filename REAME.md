# Plan

* First I turned all the id's to only numbers to make the div id match the hour number that I need.
* In class they showed a split method but I found this way easier. 
* I first made a savebutton. I ran it just as a function first to test it out. Later I added an event listner on it so everytime I clicked it would save the description in the local storage.
* Next I made sure to add some getItem's from the local storage so the function would be able to make it where when I refreshed the page it would show all the items.
* Lastly I deleted future, present, and now, from the html classes and made a function where it would match up the hour with the div id's to display the right css style on the divs of the description. 
* I had to delete Repository that I made yesterday on the 6th of January because I changed up my whole gameplan. In office hours they showed different methods of doing things and I figured I'd start over. 
* I am going to make a commit for every function added so I have at least some history of commits.
